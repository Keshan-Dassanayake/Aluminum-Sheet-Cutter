<h1>Aluminum Sheet Cutter</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This aluminum sheet cutter was developed as part of an environmental sustainability project aimed at recycling aluminum cans. The process begins with used aluminum cans being crushed using a can crusher, then melted down into a reusable form. Once solidified, the aluminum is processed by this machine to create precise, ruler-like metal sheets. These sheets can be repurposed for various applications, promoting efficient recycling and minimizing waste. The project highlights innovative engineering and eco-friendly practices in material reuse and resource conservation.
